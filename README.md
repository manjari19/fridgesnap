About the Project
Inspiration
The idea for FridgeSnap came from a simple, everyday problem we all face:
standing in front of an open fridge and still not knowing what to cook.

Most recipe apps start by asking “What do you want to eat?” — but the harder question is often “What can I make with what I already have?”
We wanted to flip that flow. Instead of starting with recipes, we start with the fridge.

We were inspired by how often food goes to waste, how much time is lost deciding what to cook, and how intimidating cooking can feel when you’re short on time or confidence. FridgeSnap is designed to reduce that friction and help people cook right now, using what they already have.

What We Built
FridgeSnap is a web app that:

Lets users upload a photo of their fridge
Detects ingredients from the image (with an option to edit or add missing items)
Personalizes recipe suggestions based on:
Cooking proficiency
Time available
Time of day / meal type
Displays simple, achievable recipes that prioritize existing ingredients
Allows users to save, rate, and revisit recipes
The focus was not on building a massive recipe database, but on creating a smooth, friendly flow that feels approachable and intuitive.

Challenges We Faced
One of the biggest challenges was scope control.

It was tempting to add:

nutrition tracking
grocery integrations
meal planning
user accounts
But with a limited timeframe, we learned that a focused, polished experience is more valuable than many half-finished features.

Another challenge was designing around uncertainty:

A fridge photo may miss items
Quantities are unknown
Preferences vary widely
We addressed this by:

Adding an ingredient confirmation step
Keeping calorie information out of the core MVP
Clearly showing which ingredients are used vs optional

What We Learned
This project reinforced a few key lessons:

Great products often come from reframing the starting point, not adding complexity
Designing for imperfection (e.g. imperfect image detection) builds trust
Warm, human-centered design matters just as much as technical features
In a short hackathon, clarity beats completeness

What’s Next
With more time, we’d love to:

Integrate real vision and recipe APIs
Learn from user ratings to improve recommendations
Add dietary preferences and nutrition estimates
Expand support for leftovers and partial ingredients
For now, FridgeSnap demonstrates how a small shift in perspective — starting from what you already have — can make cooking easier, faster, and more enjoyable.
