> **Turn what’s in your fridge into something you can cook — instantly.**

FridgeSnap is a web app that helps people decide what to cook by starting with what they *already have*, not what they’re craving. Upload a photo of your fridge, confirm the ingredients, and get simple, achievable recipe ideas tailored to your time and cooking confidence.

## 🌟 Inspiration

The idea for **FridgeSnap** came from a simple, everyday problem:

> Standing in front of an open fridge and still not knowing what to cook.

Most recipe apps ask *“What do you want to eat?”* — but the harder (and more realistic) question is often:

> **“What can I make with what I already have?”**

We wanted to flip the flow. Instead of starting with recipes, we start with the fridge.

FridgeSnap was inspired by:

* How often food goes to waste
* How much time is lost deciding what to cook
* How intimidating cooking can feel when time, energy, or confidence is low

Our goal was to reduce friction and help people cook **right now**, using what’s already in front of them.

## 🛠️ What We Built

FridgeSnap is a web app that:

* 📸 Lets users upload a photo of their fridge
* 🥕 Detects ingredients from the image (with an option to edit or add missing items)
* 🎯 Personalizes recipe suggestions based on:

  * Cooking proficiency
  * Time available
  * Time of day / meal type
* 🍳 Displays simple, achievable recipes that prioritize existing ingredients
* ⭐ Allows users to save, rate, and revisit recipes

Rather than building a massive recipe database, we focused on creating a **smooth, friendly flow** that feels approachable and intuitive.

## ⚠️ Challenges We Faced

### 1. Scope Control

It was tempting to add:

* Nutrition tracking
* Grocery store integrations
* Meal planning
* User accounts

With a limited timeframe, we learned that a **focused, polished experience** is far more valuable than many half-finished features.

### 2. Designing Around Uncertainty

Fridge photos are imperfect:

* Some items may be hidden
* Quantities are unknown
* Preferences vary widely

We addressed this by:

* Adding an ingredient confirmation step
* Keeping calorie and nutrition data out of the MVP
* Clearly showing which ingredients are **required** vs **optional**

---

## 📚 What We Learned

This project reinforced several key lessons:

* Great products often come from **reframing the starting point**, not adding complexity
* Designing for imperfection (e.g. imperfect image detection) builds user trust
* Warm, human-centered design matters just as much as technical features
* In a short hackathon, **clarity beats completeness**

## 🚀 What’s Next

With more time, we’d love to:

* Integrate real computer vision and recipe APIs
* Learn from user ratings to improve recommendations
* Add dietary preferences and nutrition estimates
* Expand support for leftovers and partial meals

**FridgeSnap** is about making cooking feel easier, friendlier, and less wasteful — one fridge photo at a time.
